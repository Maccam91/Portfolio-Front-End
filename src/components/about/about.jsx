            <div className="a-desc">Born and raised native Houstonian. <br/> Growing up as an avid gamer I've always loved finding creative solutions to puzzles and problems.<br/>My years in retail management and an early career within the IT field have given me a very good understanding of userâ€™s frustrations and how to break them down into ways I can solve them. <br/>Working in environments like this have taught me a wealth of skills. <br/>Needed to work as a team, lead a team, and to solve issues that could arise at a moment's notice.<br/>What I bring is an empathetic approach to the team where I will actively listen to <br/>the customer / clients / or my co-workers problems to have a better understanding what it is they need from me.
            <br/>Outside of my excellent softskills I have spent the last 6 months taking on the journey of transitioning my career to that of a software engineer.<br/> I bootcamped with <a className="a-link" href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>  building projects and learning the <span className="skills-bold">Skills shown below.</span>
